## FAQ

**Q: How do I back up my data?**  
A: Use **Export vault** in your client and save the JSON file.

**Q: What if I forget the master password?**  
A: It can’t be recovered (end-to-end encryption). Keep it safe.

**Q: Can multiple people use it?**  
A: Yes. The first registered user becomes the admin. The admin can generate invite codes from the admin panel, and other users register with those codes.
